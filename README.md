# RTE Operator

Operator to manage the [RTE - resource topology exporter](https://github.com/openshift-kni/resource-topology-exporter).
Using this operator, you can deploy and undeploy easily RTE in your openshift cluster. The operator also takes care of
deploying the [Node Resource Topology API](https://github.com/k8stopologyawareschedwg/noderesourcetopology-api) on which the resource topology exporter depends to provide the data.
